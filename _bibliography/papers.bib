    abstract = "{The dynamic conformation of RNA molecules within living cells is key to their function. Recent advances in probing the RNA structurome in vivo, including the use of SHAPE (Selective 2′-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) or kethoxal reagents or DMS (dimethyl sulfate), provided unprecedented insights into the architecture of RNA molecules in the living cell. Here, we report the establishment of lead probing in a global RNA structuromics approach. In order to elucidate the transcriptome-wide RNA landscape in the enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, we combined lead(II) acetate-mediated cleavage of single-stranded RNA regions with high-throughput sequencing. This new approach, termed ‘Lead-seq’, provides structural information independent of base identity. We show that the method recapitulates secondary structures of tRNAs, RNase P RNA, tmRNA, 16S rRNA and the rpsT 5′-untranslated region, and that it reveals global structural features of mRNAs. The application of Lead-seq to Y. pseudotuberculosis cells grown at two different temperatures unveiled the first temperature-responsive in vivo RNA structurome of a bacterial pathogen. The translation of candidate genes derived from this approach was confirmed to be temperature regulated. Overall, this study establishes Lead-seq as complementary approach to interrogate intracellular RNA structures on a global scale.}",

abstract = {Small RNAs (sRNAs) are universal posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression and hundreds of sRNAs are frequently found in each and every bacterium. In order to coordinate cellular processes in response to ambient conditions, many sRNAs are differentially expressed. Here, we asked how these small regulators are regulated using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a model system. Among the best-studied sRNAs in this plant pathogen are AbcR1 regulating numerous ABC transporters and PmaR, a regulator of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, motility, and ampicillin resistance. We report that the LysR-type regulator VtlR (also known as LsrB) controls expression of AbcR1 and PmaR. A vtlR/lsrB deletion strain showed growth defects, was sensitive to antibiotics and severely compromised in plant tumor formation. Transcriptome profiling by RNA-sequencing revealed more than 1,200 genes with altered expression in the mutant. Consistent with the function of VtlR/LsrB as regulator of AbcR1, many ABC transporter genes were affected. Interestingly, the transcription factor did not only control the expression of AbcR1 and PmaR. In the mutant, 102 sRNA genes were significantly up- or downregulated. Thus, our study uncovered VtlR/LsrB as the master regulator of numerous sRNAs. Thereby, the transcriptional regulator harnesses the regulatory power of sRNAs to orchestrate the expression of distinct sub-regulons.},

  title   = {Systematic Comparison of RNA Structure Probing Data},

  abstract = {Many bacterial pathogens are known to adjust their life style upon being exposed to diverse
environmental factors. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, for example, regulates the transcription of
more than 300 genes depending on temperature indicating the ingestion by its mammalian
host. This adaptation is further complemented by several additional regulatory layers. RNA
thermometers (RNAT), for example, regulate the expression of the pathogen’s major virulence
regulator LcrF on translational level, as well as the translation of several other genes. To
further investigate the influence of temperature on the structurome of Y. pseudotuberculosis in
vivo as well as in vitro, lead-seq and PARS (parallel analysis of RNA structure) experiments
were executed at both 25 °C and 37 °C. The chosen thermal conditions mimic the temperature
in the external reservoir as well as the host’s body temperature. This study aimed at the
analysis of the resulting data.
To generate information about pairing states from structure probing experiments, reactivity
scores were calculated from the resulting data. The reliability of information provided by
these scores was improved by implementing novel steps in the calculation pipeline,
accounting for lack of data as well as for the overall amplitude of background noise.
Temperature-induced unfolding of RNAs was found in vivo as well as in vitro. Furthermore, a
significant higher structuredness of untranslated regions at the 5ʹ-end of the transcript (5ʹ-
UTR) compared to the coding sequence was identified in vivo. This difference was not
detectable at 37 °C. A three-nucleotide structural pattern was found to be present in the coding
region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) at both temperatures, but not in the non-coding regions.
The data resulting from in vivo structure probing were also used to improve RNA structure
prediction. The application of this method to RNAs sampled at both temperatures suggested
that mRNAs might be less thermo-stable than non-coding RNAs.
To identify structural changes standing out against the general unfolding of RNA, a new
method was developed. With this method, the accumulation of significant structure alteration
in the 5ʹ-UTR of mRNAs in vivo was detected. The approach was applied to predict about 80
new RNAT candidates, among which at least six represent verified RNATs.},
