I'm a data enthusiast, interested in deciphering hidden information, and combining them with findings from life sciences. My research focuses on RNA secondary structures and Deep Learning Approahces to decipher their regulatory roles in the cell. 

I developed a pre-training approach which combines the thermodynamics model for RNA structure with state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods. I used the pre-training for [TermNN]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/TermNN.md %}), which provides Deep Learning models for the prediction of intrinsic transcription terminators in bacteria. 

Additionally, I worked with data from the global structure probing method [Lead-Seq]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/leadseq.md %}) in the [Microbiology Group](https://www.mikrobiologie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/index.html.de) of Franz Narberhaus. Besides developing the analysis for Lead-Seq, I used the resulting Lead-Scores for the [identification of RNA thermometers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/RNA_thermometers.md %}). I also contibuted to the [investigation of regulatory sRNAs](https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14695) with my knowledge about RNA sequencing. 

Recently I began my Postdoc in the [Bioinformatics Group](http://www.bioinf.rub.de/) of Axel Mosig at the Ruhr-University Bochum.
