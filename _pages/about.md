I'm a data enthusiast, interested in deciphering hidden information and combining them with findings from life sciences. I am currently investigating the inference of phylogenetic features with deep learning at the [Ruhr University Bochum](http://www.bioinf.rub.de/).


My previous projects focused on RNA secondary structures and deep learning approaches to decipher their regulatory roles in the cell. I developed a [pre-training approach]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/TermNN.md %}) which combines the thermodynamics model for RNA structure with machine learning methods to predict intrinsic transcription terminators in bacteria. Additionally, I developed the global structure probing method [Lead-Seq]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/leadseq.md %}) and used it for the identification of RNA thermometers. I also contributed to the [investigation of regulatory sRNAs](https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14695) with my knowledge about RNA sequencing.
