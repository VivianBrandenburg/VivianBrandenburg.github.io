I'm a data enthusiast, interested in deciphering hidden information, and combining them with findings from life sciences. My research focuses on RNA secondary structures and their regulatory roles in the cell. 

To investigate RNA structures, I developed a pre-training approach which combines the thermodynamics model for RNA structure with state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods. I used the pre-training for [TermNN]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/TermNN.md %}), which provides Deep Learning models for the prediction of intrinsic transcription terminators in bacteria. 

I also work with data from the global structure probing method [Lead-Seq]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/leadseq.md %}). Besides developing the analysis for Lead-Seq, I used the resulting Lead-Scores for the [identification of RNA thermometers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/RNA_thermometers.md %}). Additionally, I contibuted to the [investigation of regulatory sRNAs](https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14695) with my knowledge about RNA sequencing. 

Currently, I am a PhD student at the [Ruhr-University Bochum](https://www.mikrobiologie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mbio/mitarbeiter/brandenburg.html.en), where I'm closely cooperating with [Axel Mosig](http://www.bioinf.rub.de) from the Bioinformatics Group and [Franz Narberhaus](https://www.mikrobiologie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mbio/mitarbeiter/narberhaus.html.en) from the Microbial Biology Group.
